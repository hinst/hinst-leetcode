# Hinst Leetcode

## 2. Add two numbers
I wrote the solution on my own. First I wrote the solution in TypeScript, then I converted it to Rust. The Rust version ended up being 60 lines, meanwhile TypeScript version is only 30 lines. Later I saw shorter solutions in Rust on Leetcode.

## 1. Two Sum
I wrote the slow solution on my own. I had to look through the existing solutions to find the fast solution. There is only Rust version.

## 3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
I wrote the solution on my own. First I wrote it in TypeScript, then I converted it to Rust. Code length is similar for both solutions.

## 20. Valid Parentheses
I wrote the solutions on my own. There is only Rust version.

## 121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock
I wrote TypeScript solution myself without checking hints. However, I ended up with a complicated solution. It passed the acceptance test, but I realized that there exists a much simpler solution after I looked through the existing solutions on LeetCode. I implemented the short solution in Rust.
